## All the Major Things
The purpose of this blog is for me to talk about how Minecraft is doing and what I hope will change. Let's start with the some rumours back in 2020/21. [WhatIfGaming](https://whatifgaming.com/rumor-mojang-studios-could-be-working-on-2-new-games/) and [GameSpot](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-dev-mojang-reportedly-has-two-new-games-in-the-works/1100-6496476/) reported that Mojang is working on two new games. So, if the rumours are true, we should see a new game announced in a year or two. Just this year, Mojang announced [Minecraft Legends](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/about-legends) and is slated to release in Spring 2023, so look out for that.

Moving on, Mojang released the Wild Update, bringing more content to the game and reviving interest in the game. This update also brought many new mechanics such as vibrations, mobs eating other mobs and more. This updated finally released the long anticipated Deep Dark biome and it is amazing, turning Minecraft into somewhat a horror game. Mojang also released some new default skins bringing more diversity for players to express.

Mojang did a fantastic Minecraft Live this year, clarifying their controversy with update reveals and an amazing show overall. Speaking of mob votes, the leaks were unreal. Ranging from the [mob vote being in-game](https://twitter.com/SmokeyStack_/status/1520425244716011521) to what the [candidates](https://twitter.com/RogerBadgerman/status/1575600753728950272?cxt=HHwWgMDQnbSi1N0rAAAA) are. The leaks surely did hype up the event more which I'd argue is good for the game and community.

Speaking of community, we lost two amazing Minecraft Content creators, Technoblade and TinfoilChef. For Technoblade, Mojang has paid their respects by including a new splash text in the game, forever cementing him. Technoblade never dies! Now while TFC may not have an official Mojang tribute, the Hermitcraft community did.

Staying on the YouTube side of things, Minecraft reached 10 million subscribers and 1 trillion views on YouTube which is insane. Not bad for a 13 year old game.

## Minecraft Java
The performace on Java is still poor. Needing to rely on so many mods just to run the game smoothly should not be the case. I hope Mojang focuses mroe on performance. With the announcement of more minor updates for Java, I am hopeful for this.

Java Edition also received a controversial update in the form of the Chat Reporting Feature. I talked about it before in this blog post righ [here](/blog/chat_report_thoughts.md).

## Minecraft Bedrock
Gone with the old beta system, in with the new Preview system which is much easier and more accesible to players. iOS players finally get to joing the fun! Now that's left is for the console manufacturers of PlayStation and the Switch to allow the Preview system.

Bedrock is getting more parity features and bug fixes each preview which is fantastic. However, one of the more recent parity changes was campfires not dealing fire damage anymore which *sparked* a discussion in the community. Once again, a feature favoured towards Java rather than the Bedrock quirk. While the devs were openly communicating, this is still a huge blow since Bedrock was advertised as *the* definition of Minecraft.

Nonetheless, the future of Bedrock is bright. Spectator mode was released after 9 years since its debut in Java. Not only is this a major parity feature, but it is one step closer to Hardcore mode!

However, on the creator side of things, it's a mixed feeling. Custom biomes have been broken since 1.18 and Bedrock isn't getting as much new creator features. Granted the team is trying to make them stable and not experimental, but I miss the days where new betas would bring more creator features. On the bright side, the famously leaked [editor mode](https://twitter.com/SmokeyStack_/status/15882177247537025031) could be an amazing thing. This could help bring more creators to Bedrock.

I'm looking forward to what 2023 has in store for Bedrock.
